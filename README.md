# LoginScreenKotlinMultiPlatform

Learn how to make your existing Android application cross-platform so that it works both on Android and iOS. You'll be able to write code and test it for both Android and iOS only once, in one place.
This tutorial uses a sample Android application with a single screen for entering a username and password. The credentials are validated and saved to an in-memory database.
To make your application work on both iOS and Android, you'll first make your code cross-platform by moving some of it to a shared module. After that you'll use your cross-platform code in the Android application, and then you'll use the same code in a new iOS application.
